# 5G-and-Edge-Computing
Vehicle-Edge Server Simulation with Object Detection and Route Planning
Overview
This project demonstrates a 5G-inspired vehicle-edge server simulation that integrates edge computing to handle computationally intensive tasks. Using gRPC for communication, it showcases the following capabilities:

Object Detection: Utilizing YOLOv5 to detect objects in images captured by the vehicle.
Route Planning: Implementing the A* algorithm for efficient navigation.

Features
Real-Time Communication: Leverages gRPC for low-latency, high-efficiency communication.
Edge Computing Integration: Offloads heavy tasks to the edge server for optimal performance.
Scalability: Designed to work in 5G environments with potential for multi-vehicle setups.
System Components
Vehicle Simulation:
Captures images and sends them to the edge server.
Requests route planning computations.
Edge Server:
Processes object detection using YOLOv5.
Computes navigation routes using the A* algorithm.
Communication Protocol:
Uses gRPC and Protocol Buffers for efficient data serialization.
Installation Steps
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python libraries:
torch
opencv-python
grpcio
grpcio-tools
numpy
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/IIITV-5G-and-Edge-Computing-Activity/5G-Edge-Drive.git
cd 5G-Edge-Drive-master
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate gRPC Files
Run the following command to generate the gRPC client and server code:

python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. vehicle_edge.proto
Start the Edge Server
Run the edge server to handle incoming requests:

python edge_server.py
Run the Vehicle Simulation
Simulate the vehicle sending data to the edge server:

python vehicle.py
File Structure
vehicle.py: Simulates the vehicle capturing images and sending requests to the edge server.
edge_server.py: Handles object detection and route planning requests.
route_planning.py: Implements the A* algorithm for navigation.
vehicle_edge.proto: Defines the gRPC communication schema.
Future Work
Integration with CARLA Simulator:
Test the system in realistic driving environments.
Docker Deployment:
Package components into Docker containers for scalability.
